# Implementation of AlexNet using PyTorch

>This is an implementation of a classical convolutional neural network architecture, AlexNet, introduced in the paper

        ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

>This code uses Adam algorithm for simplicity instead of stochastic gradient descent with momentum in the original paper
